/**
 * Independent Component Analysis (ICA). ICA is a computational method
 * for separating a multivariate signal into additive components. This
 * is done by assuming that at most one subcomponent is a non-Gaussian
 * signals and that the subcomponents are statistically independent of
 * each other. ICA is a special case of blind source separation. A common
 * example application is the "cocktail party problem" of listening in
 * on one person's speech in a noisy room.
 * <p>
 * FastICA is an efficient algorithm for ICA invented by Aapo Hyv√§rinen.
 * Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, FastICA
 * introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for ICA.
 * These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole
 * decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of
 * individual independent components as projection pursuit directions.
 * <p>
 * The contrast functions must be a non-quadratic non-linear function
 * that has second-order derivative.
